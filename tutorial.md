Dr. Birdy Books Protocol Token Tutorial Script
This comprehensive tutorial will show you how to use your Dr. Birdy Books Protocol Tokens (DBBPT) to access educational content, resolve wallet import issues, and answer common questions about using your tokens.
________________________________________
Step 1: Sign In with a MetaMask or Base Wallet
You need to sign in using MetaMask or Base Wallet. Other wallets like Trust Wallet, Ledger Live, Rainbow Wallet, and Argent Wallet will not work.
If you don’t have a wallet, click the link in this description that says Get my first MetaMask wallet or Get my first Base Wallet. Both work equally well.
Pause this video now if you need to set up a wallet. If you already have MetaMask or Base Wallet, continue with the tutorial.
________________________________________
Step 2: Import DBBPT into Your Wallet
You can import DBBPT using either MetaMask or Base Wallet. Here’s how:
Using MetaMask:
•	Go to the whitepaper page on the Dr. Birdy Books website and copy the official DBBPT contract address.
•	Open your MetaMask wallet.
•	Scroll down and click Import Tokens or Add Token.
•	Select Custom Token.
•	Paste the DBBPT contract address into the Token Address field.
•	The Token Symbol and Decimals should auto-fill. If not, enter:
•	Token Symbol: DBBPT
•	Decimals: 18
•	Click Add Custom Token, then Import Tokens.
Your MetaMask wallet should now display your DBBPT balance. If it doesn’t, jump to the Troubleshooting Token Import and Wallet Issues section of this video for help, then continue the tutorial.
________________________________________
Using Base Wallet:
•	Copy the official DBBPT contract address from the whitepaper page.
•	Paste it into your Base Wallet to import the token. Base Wallet will handle the rest automatically—no further steps are needed.
Step 3: Purchase DBBPT
Once your wallet is set up and DBBPT is imported:
•	Visit the whitepaper page on the Dr. Birdy Books website (link in the video description).
•	Click the link to buy DBBPT, which will take you to Uniswap to swap Ethereum for DBBPT. Be sure to sign in with your wallet.
•	Ensure you have enough Ethereum to complete the purchase.
•	Check the whitepaper for tier pricing:
•	Tier 1 grants you access to worksheets only and requires you to stake about twenty-four dollars worth of DBBPT.
•	Tier 2 grants you access to eBooks, flashcards, and worksheets, and requires you to stake about fifty dollars worth of DBBPT. 
•	Tier 3 grants you access to the future. This requires you to stake about one thousand dollars worth of DBBPT.
•	Decide how much DBBPT you want based on your desired access. Purchase, and wait for confirmation.
•	Finally, verify your DBBPT balance in your MetaMask or Base wallet.
________________________________________
Step 4: Connect and Stake Your Tokens
•	Return to the whitepaper page and click Connect My Wallet. (You can also do this from the homepage, but the whitepaper page has everything you need in one place.)
•	This will open https://token.drbirdybooks.com where you’ll connect your wallet.
•	Click the blue Connect Wallet button in the upper right corner.
•	Choose your wallet:
•	Connect MetaMask if using MetaMask.
•	Connect Coinbase Wallet if using Base Wallet. (Base Wallet is part of the Coinbase ecosystem; the button may say “Coinbase Wallet.”)
•	Once connected, the staking dashboard will appear.
Before staking, verify your token balance by checking your wallet. When purchasing tokens, review the transaction details in MetaMask or Base Wallet and look for the line that says, for example, “You will receive $24.52 of DBBPT.” This amount reflects the tokens you’ll actually get after a 5% fee is applied, which breaks down as follows:
•	2% goes to the liquidity pool to help stabilize the market,
•	2% supports marketing and development,
•	1% is redistributed to all current token holders.
Always double-check the “You will receive” amount to ensure you have enough tokens to stake for your desired tier.
When staking, enter the number of tokens you want to stake. If you bought the minimum for a tier (e.g., $24 for Tier 1), stake the full amount including a small buffer to cover minor price fluctuations caused by market activity. For example, if you received $24.52 worth, stake the full amount to guarantee access—even if the token value dips slightly.
•	If you bought extra tokens (e.g., $150), stake only the amount needed for your tier (e.g., $50 for Tier 2) plus a small buffer. You can keep the rest unstaked for later.
•	After staking, your tokens will be locked, and the dashboard will confirm your access to the content.


Step 5: Access Content

Determine your access tier:

•	**Tier 1:** Access to all worksheets.
•	**Tier 2:** Access to worksheets, eBooks, and flashcards.
•	**Tier 3:** Access to the Tier 3 folder plus all worksheets, eBooks, and flashcards.

For this tutorial, we’ll select content from Tier 1.

Click the Worksheets folder.

Select the child’s grade level (Pre-K through 6).


Choose a subject.
If there are sub-folders, find the materials you want.

Pick and download the worksheets or the desired materials.

You can print the materials for use with a pencil and paper or let your child work on them digitally—whichever you prefer.

________________________________________
Step 6: Unstake Tokens (When Ready)
When you are ready to unstake:
•	Return to the dashboard and scroll to **Unstake Tokens**.
•	Select the number of tokens to unstake and click **Unstake**.
•	Note: A 7-day fixed waiting period is required before tokens are released. This encourages longer staking, supporting token price stability and project health.

The Most Common Question and Important Notes
Question: Could I just buy tokens, stake, download everything, then sell after the unstaking period to get my money back?

Answer: Yes, you could, but doing so misses the benefits of the protocol.
What are the benefits of the protocol token?
There are two main issues with buying, staking, downloading all content, and then unstaking:
Profit Sharing:
The token has three minor transaction fees that total 5%, but one key fee you’ll want to remember is the 1% buy/sell fee that is redistributed directly to all token holders as passive income. This means simply holding the token earns you rewards. Selling your tokens will stop you from receiving this ongoing passive income.


Continuous Access:
New content is added regularly. Selling your tokens cuts off access to future materials. You’d need to buy back in later, possibly at a higher price. Holding tokens ensures ongoing access and potential value growth.

In short:
The Dr. Birdy Books Protocol Token has turned education from an expense into an investment.

Open your Base Wallet app or extension. The active network is usually shown prominently on the main screen or in the settings menu. Check there to confirm you are connected to the correct network.

Question: Can I use wallets other than MetaMask or Base Wallet?
Answer: No, you can’t. Currently, only MetaMask and Base Wallet are supported. Other wallets like Trust Wallet or Ledger Live are not compatible.
Question: Why can’t I connect my wallet to the staking dashboard?
Answer: Ensure your wallet is unlocked, connected to the correct network, then refresh or restart your wallet app and browser if needed.

Question: I bought DBBPT tokens but can’t unstake them. What’s wrong?

Answer:  The protocol includes a 7-day fixed waiting period to encourage longer staking, support token price stability, and maintain project health. Please wait at least seven days after purchasing DBBPT before unstaking.


Question: How do I know which tier I qualify for after staking?

Answer: Your staking amount determines your tier. The dashboard will display your current tier and corresponding access.

Question: Can I stake more tokens to upgrade my tier later?

Answer: Yes, you can stake additional tokens anytime to move up to a higher tier and unlock more content.


Question: How do I check my current staked balance?

Answer: The staking dashboard shows your staked tokens and access tier in real time.

Question: What if I lose access to my wallet?

Answer: Access to content depends on your wallet and staked tokens. If you lose your wallet, you lose access unless you recover it.

Question: Can I transfer staked tokens to another wallet?

Answer: No, tokens must be unstaked before transferring. Staked tokens are locked until unstaking completes.

Question: How often is new content added?

Answer: New worksheets, eBooks, and flashcards are added regularly to keep content fresh and valuable.

Question: Is the content downloadable forever after staking?

Answer: Access lasts as long as you maintain the required staked tokens. If you unstake, access to content will be lost.

Question: What if I accidentally unstake too many tokens?

Answer: You can restake tokens anytime to regain access, but you may lose content access during the waiting period.

Question: Can I stake tokens on behalf of someone else?

Answer: No, staking is tied to the wallet owner’s access and cannot be delegated.

Question: What devices are supported for accessing content?

Answer: You can access and download content on any device that supports your wallet and file formats such as PDFs and JPEGs.


Question: How secure is my token and content access?

Answer: Access is secured by your wallet’s private keys. Keep your wallet credentials safe and never share them.

Question: What should I do if my wallet app crashes during staking?

Answer: Restart the app and check your transaction’s status on the blockchain explorer. Contact support if issues persist.

Question: Can I use a hardware wallet with MetaMask or Base Wallet?

Answer: Currently, only MetaMask and Base Wallet extensions/apps are supported; hardware wallet integration is not available.

Question: How do I update my MetaMask or Base Wallet app?

Answer: Update through your browser extension store or app store to ensure compatibility and security.

Question: What happens if I switch networks accidentally?

Answer: You won’t see your tokens or staking dashboard unless connected to the correct network, which is the Base network.

Question: Can I stake partial tokens or do I need whole tokens?

Answer: You can stake fractional amounts; tokens are divisible up to 18 decimals.

Question: How do I check transaction status for staking or buying tokens?

Answer: Use a blockchain explorer like Base Scan with your wallet address or transaction hash.

Question: Why is my token balance not updating after purchase?

Answer: It may take a few minutes for blockchain confirmation. Refresh your wallet or check your network connection.

Question: Can I use a mobile wallet to stake and access content?

Question: What if I accidentally send tokens to the wrong address?

Answer: Token transfers are irreversible. Always double-check addresses before sending.

Question: Can I gift tokens or content access to someone else?

Answer: Tokens can be transferred once unstaked, but content access is wallet-specific and non-transferable.

Question: What is the minimum amount of tokens I must hold to use the protocol?

Answer: Minimum staking amounts are set per tier as detailed in the whitepaper.

Question: How do I know if my unstaking request is complete?

Answer: After the 7-day waiting period, your tokens will be unlocked and available in your wallet.

Question: Are there plans to support more wallets in the future?

Answer: Currently only MetaMask and Base Wallet are supported; future wallet support will be announced.

Question: Can I stake tokens multiple times to increase access?

Answer: You can add to your stake anytime to upgrade your tier.

Question: What if I accidentally stake less than required for a tier?

Answer: You won’t receive access for that tier until you stake the minimum amount needed.

Question: Can I stake tokens from multiple wallets to access files?
Answer: You can stake from multiple wallets, but each wallet must stake the full required amount to gain access. Splitting the required tokens across wallets will not grant access to any of the wallets that do not meet tier requirements.
Question: Are there fees for staking or unstaking tokens?
Answer: There is a total 5% fee on token buys and sells, which includes:
•	2% to the liquidity pool,
•	2% for marketing and development, and
•	1% redistributed to token holders as passive income.
However, staking and unstaking tokens themselves do not have any additional fees.





Question: What happens if the token price changes after I stake? 

Answer: Your tier access is based on the USD value of your tokens at the time you staked. This means your access remains the same even if the token price changes later. You only need to stake more tokens if you want to upgrade to a higher tier. 

Question: I purchased $24, why did I get less?
Answer: When you buy tokens, a 5% fee is applied to the transaction. This fee reduces the number of tokens you actually receive compared to the amount you paid. So if you purchased $24 worth, the amount of tokens you get will be slightly less after fees are deducted.
________________________________________
Question: What are the fees and what are they for?
Answer: The token has a 5% fee on every buy and sell transaction, broken down as follows:
•	2% goes to the liquidity pool to help stabilize the market,
•	2% funds ongoing marketing and development efforts, and
•	1% is redistributed to all current token holders as passive income rewards.
________________________________________
Question: How much should I purchase to apply for a tier?
Answer: To qualify for a staking tier, check the “You will receive” amount shown in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Base Wallet) when you complete your purchase. This amount reflects the tokens you will actually receive after fees. Make sure this amount meets or slightly exceeds the staking threshold for your desired tier to account for any small price fluctuations.
